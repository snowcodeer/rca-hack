# Planet Narrations (~50s each)

## Mercury
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and has no substantial atmosphere, so temperatures swing from extreme heat to deep cold. It’s in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance; a solar day lasts ~176 Earth days while its year is 88 days. A large iron core and a global but weak magnetic field dominate its interior. The heavily cratered surface shows lobate scarps from global contraction, and water ice persists in permanently shadowed polar craters.

## Venus
Venus is Earth-sized but wrapped in a dense CO₂ atmosphere with surface pressures ~92 times Earth’s and temperatures near 465°C beneath sulfuric-acid clouds. It rotates retrograde and very slowly; a Venus day (243 Earth days) exceeds its year (225). Radar mapping shows vast volcanic plains, tessera highlands, and signs of recent or ongoing volcanism. Despite active geology, Venus lacks Earth-style plate tectonics.

## Earth
Earth is the only known world with persistent surface liquid water, a nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere, and active plate tectonics that recycle crust and regulate climate. A global magnetic field and a moderate greenhouse effect keep conditions stable for life. Oxygen is produced by photosynthesis, and the Moon helps stabilize Earth’s axial tilt and tides. Earth rotates every ~24 hours and orbits the Sun in ~365 days within the habitable zone.

## Mars
Mars has a thin CO₂ atmosphere, cold temperatures, and widespread iron-oxide dust. Olympus Mons is the solar system’s largest volcano, and Valles Marineris is a canyon system that spans continents. Ancient river valleys, deltas, and water-altered minerals indicate long-lived surface water in the past; today most water resides as polar and subsurface ice. Global dust storms occur seasonally, and small moons Phobos and Deimos orbit the planet.

## Jupiter
Jupiter is the largest planet, more than twice as massive as all the others combined. Fast rotation (~10 hours) drives strong jet streams and long-lived storms such as the Great Red Spot, making the planet oblate. Deep pressures create liquid metallic hydrogen, generating an intense magnetic field and powerful auroras. The Galilean moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—form a diverse system, and Jupiter also has faint rings.

## Saturn
Saturn is a gas giant known for its bright, extensive rings made of ice and rock fragments. It rotates rapidly, shows banded clouds, and hosts a persistent hexagonal jet stream at the north pole. Titan has a thick atmosphere with methane rivers, lakes, and rain, while Enceladus vents water-rich plumes from a subsurface ocean containing organic molecules. Saturn’s low average density is less than that of water.

## Uranus
Uranus is an ice giant whose blue-green color comes from methane absorbing red light. It is tilted by ~98°, effectively rotating on its side, which produces decades-long seasons and a highly tilted, offset magnetic field. Uranus emits little internal heat compared with its peers and has thin, dark rings. Its small icy moons and occasional bright storms provide a nearby laboratory for ice-giant physics.

## Neptune
Neptune is a distant ice giant colored deep blue by methane and known for the fastest winds in the solar system, exceeding 1,000 mph. Strong internal heat drives dynamic weather, including transient dark storms and high clouds, above an icy, volatile-rich interior. The planet has faint rings and is orbited by Triton, a large moon with a retrograde orbit and nitrogen geysers that suggest internal activity. Neptune was discovered in 1846 based on mathematical predictions.
